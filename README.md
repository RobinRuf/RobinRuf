# Introducing
Hi there, my name is Robin and i'm a freelancer for Websites, iOS-, iPadOS- and Android-Apps.

I'm learning since 2012 a few languages for Web-Development like Html, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL and a few more.
At 2017 I started to learn C# and Java to build my first Applications for Android.
Since 2020, i've started to learn Swift (SwiftUI) to finally start building iOS and iPadOS Apps and publish these to the AppStore.

I registered me on Twago.de, a website for freelancers to get projects a few years ago - and now, in 2021, i'm finally back at Twago.de and started to build a few little projects for companies and private persons.
