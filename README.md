# Introducing
Hello, my name is Robin and I'm a Mobile- and Web-Developer based in Switzerland.

I started my coding career back in 2012. I wanted to create my own Browser Game with a few friends but couldn't write any code. So I decided to teach myself. Started with the basics of HTML and CSS but went straight forward to JavaScript and loved it.

Since then I nearly mastered JavaScript and went forward to different Frameworks and Libraries for advanced Webdevelopment with JavaScript. In 2021 I found out about React.JS and was directly satisfied by this Library. Since then I mostly created projects for customers or myself with React.JS or Next.JS and for my mobile projects I love to use React Native.

# Projects
I developed many projects for customers, friends and myself with these Frameworks and Libraries.
I also builded many clones of popular websites to gain experience and learn more and more!

# Want to hire me?
