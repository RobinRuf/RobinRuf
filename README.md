# Introducing
Hi there, my name is Robin and i'm a Mobile- and Web-Developer from Switzerland.

I'm learning since 2011 a few languages for Web-Development like Html, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL/NoSQL.
I began to learn other languages too like C#, Java and Python a few years ago. I also launched a Browsergame in 2016 which was coded with C# and the .NET Framework.
Since 2018, i've started to learn Swift and Kotlin to build my first mobile applications on iOS and Android.
I already did a few Projects in Kotlin for different Clients/Customers.

I recognized, that my passion is to create website and mobile apps. But i searched for a "better" way to code that all without need to be master in multiple different languages!
In 2021 i heard about ReactJS and React-Native. The possibility to write one code and deploy it to web and mobile intrigued me. So i started to learn coding using ReactJS and React-Native.

# Projects
I builded many little projects, most of these just to learn the language.
The most beautiful projects are the different "clones" which i made to learn more about ReactJS, React-Native, NextJS and so on.
These are linked in my profile down below. For example the Medium-Clone or the Google Docs-Clone are pretty nice in my opinion!

I already created a few Websites with ReactJS and NextJS with server-side rendering for different client since 2022.

If you wanna contact me for an upcomming project, use my contact data in my github profile like my personal website. (My Website is also a personal portfolio of my projects and programming skills.)
