# Introducing
Hi there, my name is Robin and i'm a freelancer for Websites, iOS-, iPadOS- and Android-Apps.

I'm learning since 2011 a few languages for Web-Development like Html, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL and a few more.
At 2017 I started to learn C# and Java to build my first Applications for Android with Unity3D!
Since 2018, i've started to learn Swift (SwiftUI) to finally start building iOS and iPadOS Apps and publish these to the AppStore.

I registered me on different Websites for freelancers to get projects a few years ago.

# Projects
I builded many little projects, most of these just to learn the language.
But a few, I builded to publish it to the web or even the apples AppStore.

Primary, i build different mobile application for customers with SwiftUI (iOS) and Kotlin (Android).
I also started to create small websites as a freelancer.
