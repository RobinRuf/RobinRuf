# Introducing
Hi there, my name is Robin and i'm a freelancer for Websites, iOS-, iPadOS- and Android-Apps.

I'm learning since 2011 a few languages for Web-Development like Html, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL and a few more.
At 2017 I started to learn C# and Java to build my first Applications for Android.
Since 2020, i've started to learn Swift (SwiftUI) to finally start building iOS and iPadOS Apps and publish these to the AppStore.

I registered me on Twago.de, a website for freelancers to get projects a few years ago - and now, in 2021, i'm finally back at Twago.de and started to build a few little projects for companies and private persons.

# Projects
I builded many little projects, most of these just to learn the language.
But a few of these, I builded to publish it to the web or even the apples AppStore.

2021 I published my own website https://codinglegacy.io where I show my projects which I builded.
Also in 2021, I published my first App "FruityRecipes" on the AppStore.
I'm developed a drinking game too, which I will publish mid 2021 on the AppStore.
